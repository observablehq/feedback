# Observable Feedback README  

Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback. 

Please [submit your issue](https://github.com/observablehq/feedback/issues/new/choose) and give us as much detail as possible. If the `feature request` or `bug` templates do not cover your needs, feel free to open a blank issue. 

After your issue is submitted, we will do our best to assign it labels that suggest how it will be handled. A "Top N" label indicates that the feature or improvement is on the [current roadmap](https://github.com/observablehq/feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Top+N%22).

See an issue you were planning on submitting? **Give it a üëç as a +1.**

We look forward to your feedback!
